# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis using Association Rule Mining  
**Applied Association Rule Mining (Apriori, FP-Growth)**  

## 📌 Overview  
This study presents **Market Basket Analysis** using **Association Rule Mining**, specifically applying the **Apriori** and **FP-Growth** algorithms. The analysis is based on datasets from **Kaggle**, aiming to uncover relationships between purchased items and derive insights for business strategy optimization.  

The study compares the performance of both algorithms in terms of **processing time** and **memory usage** across two datasets:  

| Dataset | Transactions | Unique Items |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Market Basket Analysis Data** | 999 | 17 |
| **Market Basket Analysis** | 9,835 | 169 |
